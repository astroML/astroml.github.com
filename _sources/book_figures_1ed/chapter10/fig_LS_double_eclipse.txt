Lomb-Scargle Aliasing
---------------------
Figure 10.18

Analysis of a light curve where the standard Lomb-Scargle periodogram fails to
find the correct period (the same star as in the top-left panel in figure
10.17). The two top panels show the periodograms (left) and phased light curves
(right) for the truncated Fourier series model with M = 1 and M = 6 terms.
Phased light curves are computed using the incorrect aliased period favored by
the M = 1 model. The correct period is favored by the M = 6 model but
unrecognized by the M = 1 model (bottom-left panel). The phased light curve
constructed with the correct period is shown in the bottom-right panel. This
case demonstrates that the Lomb-Scargle periodogram may easily fail when the
signal shape significantly differs from a single sinusoid.
