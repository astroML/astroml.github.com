1D Gaussian Mixture Example
---------------------------
Figure 4.2.

Example of a one-dimensional Gaussian mixture model with three components.
The left panel shows a histogram of the data, along with the best-fit model
for a mixture with three components. The center panel shows the model selection
criteria AIC (see Section 4.3) and BIC (see Section 5.4) as a function of the
number of components. Both are minimized for a three-component model. The
right panel shows the probability that a given point is drawn from each class
as a function of its position. For a given x value, the vertical extent of
each region is proportional to that probability. Note that extreme values
are most likely to belong to class 1.
