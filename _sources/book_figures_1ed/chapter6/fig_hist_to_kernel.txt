Histogram vs Kernel Density Estimation
--------------------------------------
Figure 6.1

Density estimation using histograms and kernels. The top panels show two
histogram representations of the same data (shown by plus signs in the bottom
of each panel) using the same bin width, but with the bin centers of the
histograms offset by 0.25. The middle-left panel shows an adaptive histogram
where each bin is centered on an individual point and these bins can overlap.
This adaptive representation preserves the bimodality of the data. The
remaining panels show kernel density estimation using Gaussian kernels with
different bandwidths, increasing from the middle-right panel to the
bottom-right, and with the largest bandwidth in the bottom-left panel. The
trade-off of variance for bias becomes apparent as the bandwidth of the
kernels increases.
