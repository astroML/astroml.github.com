Perform Outlier Rejection with MCMC
-----------------------------------
Figure 8.9

Bayesian outlier detection for the same data as shown in figure 8.8. The
top-left panel shows the data, with the fits from each model. The top-right
panel shows the 1-sigma and 2-sigma contours for the slope and intercept with
no outlier correction: the resulting fit (shown by the dotted line) is clearly
highly affected by the presence of outliers. The bottom-left panel shows the
marginalized 1-sigma and 2-sigma contours for a mixture model (eq. 8.67). The
bottom-right panel shows the marginalized 1-sigma and 2-sigma contours for a
model in which points are identified individually as "good" or "bad"
(eq. 8.68). The points which are identified by this method as bad with a
probability greater than 68% are circled in the first panel.
