Cross Validation Examples: Part 4

Figure 8.15

The learning curves for the data given by eq. 8.75, with d = 2 and d = 3. Both
models have high variance for a few data points, visible in the spread between
training and validation error. As the number of points increases, it is clear
that d = 2 is a high-bias model which cannot be improved simply by adding
training points.
